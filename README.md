This website is a project I have been working on sporadically for a while.

Some things I learned about while building this site:</br>
Networking/network architecture</br>
Front-end web development: HTML, CSS/SASS, JS</br>
Back-end web development: Python (Flask)</br>
API integration: SendGrid, Yahoo Finance, NASDAQ</br>
